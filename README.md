# Smart-Contract-Secure-Logging
an Ethereum smart contract is developed to store the condensed data on the blockchain where only the authorized user is permitted to access the condensed data. Three levels of authorization for different users (read, write, and admin) were introduced to store and retrieve the data on the blockchain. A tag-based secure data-store mechanism was introduced in the smart contract to minimize the gas consumption of the smart contract design.
